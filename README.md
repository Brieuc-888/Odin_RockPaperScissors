# Odin_RockPaperScissors

This is a project I created for the online course Odin. 
It's a small rock-paper-scissors program written in JavaScript that 
will be linked to an HTML page. 
In the future, I plan to work on the project's appearance with CSS.

How to use
To use this program, simply download all the files from the 
repository and open them in a web browser. Then, follow the 
on-screen instructions to play the game of rock-paper-scissors.

Upcoming features
In the future, I plan to add a more sophisticated user interface 
to enhance the gaming experience. I will also be working 
on the game's appearance with CSS.

Contribution
As this is a project I intend to complete on my own, I don't 
anticipate contributions from others. However, if you do have 
suggestions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me.

I hope you enjoy playing this small rock-paper-scissors game!
